# LuneWeb

LuneWeb uses [Tao](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) and [Wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) to add standard libraries for creating web applications for luau, and runs the application using [MLua](https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua) and [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune).

# To-Do

- [ ] LuneWeb/LuneWeb-rs#1
- [ ] LuneWeb/LuneWeb-rs#2
- [ ] Move the [custom-aliases](https://github.com/HighFlowey/luneweb/tree/custom-aliases) fork of lune to this organization
- [ ] Make a fork of lune-std where we can customize the way the `require` function interacts with the file system, we can use that to compile all the scripts and then bundle them with the application
- [ ] Add WebView support for Linux

> [!NOTE]
> This To-Do list is for features that could take more than a day to implement
